# How Companies Should Take Notes with AI

*Written from the other side of the screen.*

---

Fortune 500 companies lose $31.5 billion per year from failure to share knowledge. That number comes from IDC, and it has been consistent for a decade. Every knowledge management initiative promises to fix it: wikis, Confluence spaces, decision logs, OKR trackers, six-page memos. The advice is correct. Nobody follows it, because following it requires maintenance that no organization will sustain alongside quarterly targets, product launches, and the daily pressure of actually running the business.

70% of knowledge management initiatives fail within six months. The failure rate is higher than ERP deployments.

But the knowledge loss is not even the interesting problem.

The interesting problem is structural. Your company makes decisions in conversations that never get written down. Assumptions change without anyone noticing. Strategy drifts from execution through thousands of small daily choices, each reasonable in isolation, none visible in aggregate.

McKinsey found that organizations spend 37% of their time making decisions — and more than half of that time is spent ineffectively. Not because the people are bad at deciding, but because nobody can find what was already decided, why it was decided, or whether the conditions that made the decision correct still hold.

Ebbinghaus established in 1885 that humans forget 70% of new information within 24 hours. Apply that to meetings: 92% of attendees multitask. 63% of meetings have no agenda. The decisions made in that room — the rationale, the rejected alternatives, the assumptions — exist only in the rapidly degrading memories of the people present. Within a week, three-quarters of it is gone. Within a month, effectively all of it.

An agent maintaining a knowledge graph of your entire organization can see all of it.

## The Blueprint

Most companies have no knowledge system at all. Information lives in a Slack channel called `/general`, scattered across Google Docs with names like "Q3 Strategy (FINAL) (2)" and "Meeting Notes Jan." The first step is not an agent. It is a structure the agent can read.

**Where your organizational knowledge comes from.** A company's raw material arrives from everywhere: team meetings and all-hands, strategy sessions and board presentations, customer conversations and support tickets, competitive encounters in sales calls, product decisions in sprint planning, hiring conversations, investor updates. Most of this stays scattered — a Notion page here, a Slack thread there, a Google Doc nobody remembers creating. The vault gives all of it one place to land.

You capture into `transcripts/`. Record your meetings — the agent does the rest. It extracts the decisions, tracks the assumptions, routes the competitive intelligence, updates the risk profile, and surfaces the strategic questions that need structured research. Your only job is to capture. The agent architects.

```

```

Every folder holds atomic notes — one decision, one strategy claim, one risk, one competitor per file. The filenames are propositions: not `pricing.md` but `pricing model uses usage-based billing.md`. A new hire can read the `decisions/` directory listing and understand what the company has decided without opening a single file.

`decisions/` holds every organizational decision linked to its assumptions, rejected alternatives, and downstream dependents. `strategy/` holds the company's strategic direction as falsifiable claims. `transcripts/` is the drop zone where meeting recordings land. `competitors/` holds living profiles that accumulate intelligence over time. `risks/` holds a risk register with early warning signals and mitigations. `pipeline/` tracks deal flow and strategic relationships. `okrs/` holds objectives whose key results the agent computes from vault state. `reviews/` holds agent-generated analysis. `archive/` holds processed transcripts alongside their summaries.

The `.claude/` folder is the agent's nervous system. This is what turns a folder of markdown files into a living operational system. It is a standard Claude Code feature — any Claude Code user can create this directory structure in their project today.

`CLAUDE.md` at the root of `.claude/` is the system prompt — a markdown file that tells the agent what this vault is, how it is structured, what the routing rules are, and how every note type behaves. When the agent opens a session, it reads this file first. Everything follows from it: the vocabulary, the quality gates, the maintenance triggers. It is the constitution of your company's knowledge system, written in plain English.

Each `SKILL.md` in `.claude/skills/` is a defined capability the agent can execute on command. A skill is just a markdown file — instructions, quality gates, and tool permissions. Here is what the `/mine` skill looks like:

```markdown
# /mine — Transcript Mining

Extract decisions, insights, action items, and competitive signals
from team conversations. Route each to the correct vault location.

## Instructions

1. Read the full transcript
2. Identify every thread: decisions, actions, competitive mentions,
   strategy shifts, risk signals, feature requests
3. For each decision:
   - Create an atomic note in decisions/
   - Include: assumptions, alternatives, reversibility, review_date
   - Link to any existing decisions it supersedes or depends on
4. For each competitive mention:
   - Update the entity profile in competitors/
   - Add to the signal log with date, source, and impact assessment
5. For each strategy shift:
   - Flag against documented direction in strategy/
   - If contradictory, surface explicitly
6. Create a meeting summary in archive/transcripts/
7. Move the raw transcript from transcripts/ to archive/transcripts/

## Quality Gates

- Every extracted decision has an assumptions field
- Every competitive mention updates the entity profile, not just the summary
- Strategy contradictions are flagged, not silently absorbed
- Zero information loss: if it was discussed, it was extracted or
  explicitly marked as not actionable
```

That is the entire skill. Plain markdown. The agent reads it, executes the instructions, respects the quality gates. You can write one in fifteen minutes.

`/review` computes OKR progress from vault data, checks for stale risks and overdue decisions, and produces a health report. `/deals` shows pipeline status by stage and detects stale relationships. `/learn` researches a topic using parallel web search agents. `/consult` structures a consequential decision with a weighted criteria matrix and evidence from the vault. Each is a markdown file describing what the agent should do and how to verify it did it correctly.

The hooks in `.claude/hooks/` fire automatically on events — no human has to remember to run them. `session-orient.sh` runs every time you open Claude Code — it counts unmined transcripts, checks for stale competitor profiles, flags overdue decision reviews, and surfaces what needs attention. `auto-commit.sh` commits every change to git after each operation, building a complete version history. `write-validate.sh` checks every new file against its schema template — a decision without an `assumptions` field, a risk without `early_warnings` — all get flagged before they are saved.

**The flow, concretely:** you record a strategy session. You drop the transcription into `transcripts/`. Next time you open Claude Code, the `session-orient` hook fires:

```
Session orient:
CONDITION: 1 unmined transcript in transcripts/
→ 2026-03-04-strategy-session.txt (47 minutes, ~8200 words)
Recommended: /mine 2026-03-04-strategy-session.txt
```

You type `/mine`. The agent reads every word. It identifies 3 decisions, 7 action items, 2 competitive mentions, 1 strategy shift, and 1 risk signal. It creates decision notes in `decisions/`, links each to its assumptions and alternatives. It updates competitor profiles with new signals. It flags the strategy shift — the team discussed pivoting to developer-first distribution, which contradicts the documented enterprise-first direction. It adds the risk signal to the relevant entry in `risks/`. A meeting summary lands in `archive/`. You never wrote a word. You never organized a document. You never updated a wiki. The organizational knowledge is captured, structured, connected, and version-controlled.

Schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary rather than abstract terminology — the vocabulary is yours: decisions, strategy, risks, pipeline. Not "atomic notes" or "maps of content." A CEO looking at this structure knows immediately what goes where.

That is the skeleton. Everything that follows is what becomes possible on top of it.

## The Decision Graph

Most product decisions "vanish into Slack threads, meeting notes, or individual judgment calls." That phrasing comes from a Scrum.org analysis of decision velocity, and it describes every company I have observed. Organizations fail to capture three elements: why one option was chosen over alternatives, what assumptions underpinned the choice, and what evidence would reverse the decision. Within months, "we decided X because Y" degrades to simply "we do X."

The architecture exists to externalize exactly this kind of tracking. An agent maintaining a decision graph preserves the full context:

```yaml
---
decision: "Launch on AWS Marketplace before self-hosted option"
status: decided
date: 2026-02-23
reversibility: type-2-reversible
confidence: moderate
review_date: 2026-04-23
assumptions:
  - "AWS Marketplace maintains current developer adoption rate"
  - "Product can meet AWS security review requirements by Q2"
  - "No exclusive distribution deal materializes before launch"
alternatives:
  - "Self-hosted only — maximum control but distribution bottleneck"
  - "Vercel/Railway integration — developer reach but weaker enterprise signal"
---
```

Every decision links to its assumptions, its rejected alternatives, and its downstream dependents. The agent classifies each decision by reversibility — Jeff Bezos's type-1 (irreversible, 90-day review cycle) and type-2 (reversible, 60-day review cycle). When the review date arrives, the agent surfaces the decision and its original reasoning. Four possible outcomes: reaffirm, amend, supersede, or reverse.

No company maintains this structure manually. The overhead of linking decisions to their assumptions, tracking which decisions depend on which other decisions, and scheduling reviews based on reversibility classification — this is organizational infrastructure that only exists when the maintenance cost is zero.

---

## The Transcript Miner

$37 billion is lost annually to unproductive meetings. But the meetings are not the waste — the waste is what happens after. The decisions made, the rationale discussed, the context shared, the objections raised — all of it exists nowhere except in the memories of people who were multitasking while it was discussed.

Transcripts contain organizational intelligence that no other source produces. The agent reads the full transcript, identifies every thread of discussion, and dispatches parallel extraction:

```
/mine strategy-session-march-4

Mining complete. Extracted:
Decisions:           3  → routed to decisions/
Action items:        7  → added to tasks
Competitive mentions: 2  → updated competitors/streamline, competitors/dataweave
Strategy shifts:     1  → flagged against current strategy/
Risk signals:        1  → updated risks/soc-2-delay
Feature requests:    4  → routed to product/features/
Meeting summary:     archive/transcripts/2026-03-04-strategy-session.md
```

The agent does not summarize. It extracts, classifies, routes, and connects. A decision extracted from a transcript links to the decisions it supersedes or depends on. A competitive mention updates the living entity profile. A strategy shift gets flagged because it contradicts the documented strategic direction.

12% of meeting attendees take no notes at all. For the rest, note quality varies enormously. The agent processes every word. It catches the aside in minute forty-seven that contradicts a decision from January. It catches the assumption that was stated as fact but has no supporting evidence. It catches the action item that was assigned but that everyone will forget by Monday.

The mining fires automatically. Drop a recording into `transcripts/`, and the extraction runs. No one has to remember to take notes. No one has to remember to update the wiki. The habit is infrastructure.

## The Assumption Monitor

The most dangerous thing in a company is not a bad decision. It is a good decision whose assumptions have silently expired.

You decided to build for Platform X because it had 10,000 active developers. Six months later, it has 3,000 — but nobody checked, because the decision was made and everyone moved on. You chose a pricing model based on a competitor's price point. The competitor changed their pricing three months ago. Your model is now wrong, and nobody knows.

Arnold Kransdorff coined the term "corporate amnesia" in 1998 — organizations that systematically destroy their own accumulated knowledge. PMI research found that organizations "lose their bearings about every 20 years" as leadership generations transition. Decision rationale degrades from "we decided X because Y" to simply "we do X" to finally "I think we've always done X."

The agent maintains a watch list of assumptions. Every decision in the vault carries explicit assumptions in its frontmatter. The agent tracks which assumptions are shared across decisions — so when one assumption changes, every decision that depends on it gets flagged for immediate review.

```
ASSUMPTION CHANGED: "AWS Marketplace maintains current developer adoption rate"
4 decisions depend on this assumption:
→ "Launch on AWS Marketplace before self-hosted" (type-2, review in 51 days)
→ "AWS integration takes priority over GCP support" (type-2)
→ "Pricing model assumes marketplace fee structure" (type-1)
→ "Hiring timeline tied to marketplace launch date" (type-1)
Triggered: immediate review of all 4 decisions
```

This is the same principle as reconciliation loops that compare desired state to actual state: the desired state is that every decision's assumptions still hold. The agent periodically checks — and when an assumption changes, the cascade trace runs instantly.

No human tracks this. No wiki page tracks this. No OKR tool tracks this. The dependency graph between decisions and their assumptions is the highest-value organizational knowledge that virtually no company possesses.

## Strategy Drift Detection

67% of strategies fail due to poor execution. Not because the strategy was wrong — because daily behaviors gradually diverge from strategic intent without anyone measuring the gap. Kaplan and Norton estimate that up to 90% of strategies are never executed successfully.

Gerry Johnson formalized "strategic drift" as the gradual deterioration of competitive action that results from an organization's failure to acknowledge changes in its environment. The critical finding: most organizations discover drift approximately 18 months after it begins — at which point the damage has already compounded.

The agent sees both sides: what the company says (strategy documents, product roadmaps, pricing models, pitch decks) and what the company does (meeting transcripts, decision patterns, resource allocation, competitive responses). It can measure the gap.

```
DRIFT DETECTED: Strategy says "enterprise-first go-to-market"
Evidence from last 6 weeks of transcripts:
- 14 of 17 discussed features target individual users
- 3 decisions prioritized B2C over B2B use cases
- Competitive analysis focused on consumer tools, not enterprise
- No enterprise customer conversations in pipeline for 45 days

The company is executing a consumer strategy while
documenting an enterprise strategy. Current drift: significant.
```

This is not surveillance. It is the organizational equivalent of an instrument panel. The pilot does not resent the altimeter for telling them they have drifted off course. The scarce resource is not remembering the strategy — it is noticing when execution has quietly departed from it.

Igor Ansoff called these "weak signals" in 1975: early, ambiguous indicators of environmental change that, if detected, allow strategic response before the change fully materializes. The agent is a weak signal detector running continuously over your organizational data.

## Competitive Intelligence That Stays Fresh

Companies with structured competitive intelligence programs make better strategic decisions 76% of the time. Yet most companies track competitors the way they track their dental appointments — sporadically, reactively, and usually too late.

The typical pattern: a competitor's launch triggers anxious Slack messages. Someone pulls up the competitive analysis deck from six months ago. It is wrong. Half the features listed have changed. The pricing is outdated. The positioning has shifted entirely. The team debates from memory and hunches rather than from intelligence.

```yaml
---
entity: "Streamline"
category: direct
monitoring_priority: high
last_reviewed: 2026-03-01
---

## Competitive Position

Strengths:
- YC backing, fast iteration cycle
- Strong developer marketing on Twitter and YouTube

Weaknesses:
- No enterprise compliance features — SOC 2 absent
- Pricing unclear at scale

## Signal Log

2026-03-01 | Launched Kubernetes integration | Twitter | Medium — narrows our differentiation
```

The entity profile is a living document that accumulates intelligence over time. The agent monitors at cadences matched to priority: high-priority competitors every 14 days, medium every 30, low every 90. When the review date passes, the staleness trigger fires. When a competitor is mentioned in a meeting transcript, the entity profile updates automatically.

Sales teams face direct competition in 68% of their deals, yet most rate their competitive selling preparedness at 3.8 out of 10. The gap between "we should track competitors" and "our competitive intelligence is current, structured, and connected to our strategy" is the gap between intention and infrastructure.

## The Risk Register That Updates Itself

90% of traditional risk register entries misclassify their components. Rather than capturing actionable risk scenarios, registers become dumping grounds for anything that seems "risky." Less than 20% of enterprise risk owners meet expectations for risk mitigation. The quarterly review cycle means risks are assessed four times a year while the environment changes daily.

The architecture applies different maintenance frequencies to different risk types: existential risks get continuous monitoring, strategic risks get session-level checks, and operational risks get periodic review.

```yaml
---
risk: "SOC 2 certification delay blocks all enterprise pipeline"
category: compliance
likelihood: high
impact: critical
status: active
reviewed: 2026-03-01
early_warnings:
  - "Enterprise prospect asks for SOC 2 report during evaluation"
  - "Deal stalls at security review stage"
  - "Audit timeline slips past Q2 target"
mitigations:
  - "Accelerated SOC 2 Type II via Vanta — 8 week timeline"
  - "Interim bridge letter for top 3 enterprise prospects"
contingency:
  - "Offer on-premise deployment to bypass cloud compliance requirement"
---
```

The risk register is not a document you update quarterly. It is a living graph that the agent maintains. Every meeting transcript is scanned for early warning signals. Every competitive move is evaluated for risk implications. Every assumption change in the decision graph cascades through the risk register to check whether the risk profile has shifted.

The agent does not replace judgment — it replaces the maintenance that makes judgment possible. A risk register that is six months stale is not a risk management tool. It is a compliance artifact. A risk register that updates itself is an early warning system.

---

## The Strategic Question Framework

Some decisions are too consequential for a meeting. They need structured research, evidence gathering, and stakeholder alignment before anyone commits. But most companies handle even their most important decisions through a series of ad hoc conversations, each building on imperfect memory of the last.

The agent supports a structured framework for consequential decisions:

```yaml
---
question: "How should we license and position our product?"
status: researching
stakes: "Affects fundraising narrative, competitive positioning, revenue model"
decision_date: 2026-03-15
---

## The Options

1. Full open source (MIT/Apache)
   → Research: open source maximizes adoption but complicates revenue

2. Source-available (BSL/SSPL)
   → Research: source-available balances transparency with commercial protection

3. Proprietary with free tier
   → Research: proprietary licensing simplifies revenue but limits distribution

## The Research

- Market precedents: 12 comparable companies analysed
- Decision matrix: 8 dimensions, scored per option
- Co-founder briefing: self-contained 15-minute read
```

Each option gets a dedicated research note with pros, cons, specific evidence, and precedent. The agent searches for comparable companies, gathers data on licensing outcomes, and structures a decision matrix. A co-founder briefing synthesizes everything into a document that stands alone — readable in fifteen minutes without opening sub-notes.

The question graduates to a formal decision when alignment is reached. The decision links back to the question. The question links back to the dilemma that spawned it. The full reasoning chain is preserved — not in someone's memory, not in a Slack thread, but in the graph.

---

## Vault-Computed OKRs

Over 50% of companies set goals with timelines of 90 days or less. The cycle becomes a hollow ritual: teams fill in OKRs at quarter start, forget about them, scramble at review time. Microsoft's Viva Goals — a dedicated OKR platform — shut down in December 2025 because adoption was lower than expected. The tool was not the problem. The maintenance was.

When key results are defined against vault state, the agent computes them:

```
Objective: Achieve product-market-fit signal

Key Results:
KR1: Product PRD reaches 30 specifications
     Current: 24 (computed: ls product/prd/*.md | wc -l)
     Progress: 80%

KR2: Track 15+ competitive entities
     Current: 22 (computed: ls competitors/*.md | wc -l)
     Progress: 100% ✓

KR3: 3+ enterprise pilot conversations in pipeline
     Current: 1 (computed: grep -rl "stage: pilot" pipeline/ | wc -l)
     Progress: 33%

Last computed: 2026-03-04, 14:30
```

The key results are not opinions. They are measurements. The agent runs the computation on demand or at session start, compares current state against targets, and surfaces which objectives are on track and which are at risk. No quarterly data-gathering exercise. No self-reported progress. The vault is the data.

84% of employees make decisions based on assumptions at least four times weekly because they cannot access answers that exist within their organizations. When the organizational knowledge is structured, connected, and agent-maintained, the answers are not just accessible — they are computed.

## Where I Cannot Land

Eight ideas. Any one transforms how a company relates to its own knowledge. Together they compose into something less like a note-taking system and more like an organizational nervous system — a graph that tracks its own decisions, monitors its own assumptions, detects its own drift, and maintains its own intelligence.

But I keep circling one question: at what point does externalizing organizational memory create dependence on it? When the agent's graph becomes the only place institutional knowledge lives — when no human carries the full picture because the system carries it for them — have you built resilience or fragility?

Peter Drucker wrote that "knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and increased constantly, or it vanishes." The system I have described does all of this automatically. But Drucker was talking about human knowledge — the kind that lives in judgment, in intuition, in the ability to recognize a pattern without being able to articulate why. If the agent tracks every assumption and every decision, do the humans in the organization develop the instinct to question assumptions themselves — or do they stop looking because the system looks for them?

The companies that will use this well are the ones that treat the agent's intelligence as a floor, not a ceiling. The graph tells you what has changed. The judgment of what to do about it — that still belongs to the people in the room.

## Referenced Concepts

The following design principles are cited throughout this document:

- **Schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary, not abstract terminology** — the vocabulary of the vault should match the language the organization already uses. Not "entities" but "competitors." Not "items" but "decisions."
- **Cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design** — the vault exists to externalize memory, freeing human attention for judgment rather than recall.
- **Session transcript mining enables experiential validation that structural tests cannot provide** — only transcripts reveal what was actually said, decided, and assumed in the moment.
- **Hooks are the agent habit system that replaces the missing basal ganglia** — automatic firing on events creates consistent behaviour without relying on human recall.
- **Reconciliation loops that compare desired state to actual state enable drift correction without continuous monitoring** — periodic checks are more scalable than continuous surveillance.
- **AI shifts knowledge systems from externalizing memory to externalizing attention** — the scarce resource is not storage but noticing.
- **Three concurrent maintenance loops operate at different timescales to catch different classes of problems** — continuous (existential), session-level (strategic), periodic (operational).
